The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Dataset 

https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_dataset.html

Overview
 

Single-image, multi-class classification problem
More than 40 classes
More than 50,000 images in total
Large, lifelike database
Reliable ground-truth data due to semi-automatic annotation
Physical traffic sign instances are unique within the dataset
(i.e., each real-world traffic sign only occurs once)
